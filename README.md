#PSM - Pattern Synthesis Model

“PSM” aims to explore the opposite direction. Instead of breadth, the model focuses on depth within a single writer’s worldview. The training dataset consists exclusively of personal essays, reflections, and short philosophical notes. This creates an unusually consistent dataset. Because of this consistency, the model is able to learn not only surface level phrasing but also the patterns of reasoning and rhythm of thought that run through the original texts.
The central idea behind “PSM” is simple. If a dataset contains a clear cognitive fingerprint, then a model does not need scale to learn it. It only needs to be designed with enough capacity and trained with enough stability to extract patterns that matter.
